2016/08/20 DNL: Beta release 3.2b01

2024/03/20 FVK: Cleanup for VS2019, Windows 10. Release 3.20
                Got rid of many warnings. Fixed project files, and
                 lowercased all filenames. Renamed pdw.cpp to main.cpp.
                Added ARM and ARM64 platforms.
                Added USE_SSL conditional (utils/smtp.cpp) to make the
                 SSL library optional - for now needed for ARM target.
                Updated to use headers/version.h to contain all program
                 version information.
                Renamed SSL library path to drop version, so we do not
                 have to keep updating the project files all the time.

2024/03/21 FVK:	Set the new version info to 3.2.0.0.

2024/03/22 FVK:	More cleanups, many more. Started to reorganize code into
		 more logical modules (and folders), and converting code
		 back to standard C where possible.

2024/03/23 FVK:	Added code to "track back" the installation root from where
		 the executable is, in case we have it in a subfolder of the
		 installation path (C:\HAM\PDW\bin\arm64\PDW.exe, as an
		 example.)  Version bumbped to 3.2.0.2.
		Removed our local copy of OpenSSL; moved to the official
		 distribution of version 1.1.1w (OpenSSL for Windows.)

2024/03/24 FVK:	Did some more cleaning of the Pogsag and Flex modules to
		 making local stuff static, remove unneeded visibility and
		 so on, preparing it for conversion to standard C.
		Changed the project files to use a single property sheet
		 for the OpenSSL library (see PDW.OpenSSL.props for its
		 parameters.)
